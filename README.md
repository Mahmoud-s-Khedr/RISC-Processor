# RISC Architecture

This project was divided into two key phases: a single-cycle phase and a pipeline phase.

In the single-cycle phase, we focused on designing a processor that could execute instructions in a single clock cycle. This phase was crucial in laying the groundwork for our processor's functionality and served as a solid foundation for the more complex pipeline phase.

The pipeline phase was where the project truly shined. We implemented a 5-stage pipeline, including stages for instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, memory access, and write back. This approach significantly improved the processor's performance by allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously.
